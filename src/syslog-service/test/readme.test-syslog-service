SBLIM Testsuite Enablement
--------------------------
                                                                                
The Syslog_Service provider is integrated into the SBLIM Testsuite and can be
tested via the sblim testsuite.
                                                                                
Prerequisites :
                                                                                
- sblim-cmpi-base package propertly installed
- testsuite package
                                                                                
make test : test the existence of a testsuite directory
                                                                                
make install : install the input files into the corresponding testsuite
directories
                                                                                
make uninstall : delete the cmpi-base specific files out of the testsuite
directories
                                                                                
Run the test in the testsuite dir by executing . test-cmpi-syslog-service.sh
                                                                                
NOTE: The sblim testsuite tests do not test the complete functionality of the
provider. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Old Test Scripts
-----------------

This directory contains the simple shell scripts that test the provider using
the command line interface.
The pegasus script has to be edited to put in the values for Pegasus_XXX for 
your test environment.
The script restricts itself to testing only those interfaces that are supported by the clis.
We have two scripts -
   - runtest_pegasus.sh ( which uses the pegasus CLI )
   - runtest_wbemcli.sh ( which uses the sblim wbemcli )

This test suite tests the syslog service provider interfaces.
The instance, association and method provider interfaces are tested in this script.

The instance interfaces tested are:
   - enuminstances ( for syslog_service )
   - enuminstancenames ( for syslog_service )
   - getinstance ( for syslog_service )
Both Pegasus CLI and Sblim wbemcli support the above mentioned instance tests
   
The association interfaces tested are:
   - associators ( for syslog_service and linux_unixprocess )
   - associatornames ( for syslog_service and linux_unixprocess )
   - references ( for syslog_service and linux_unixprocess )
   - referencenames ( for syslog_service and linux_unixprocess )
Both Pegasus CLI and Sblim wbemcli support the above mentioned association tests

The method interfaces (for syslog_service) tested are:
  - startservice ( RH/SUSE )
  - stopservice ( RH/SUSE )
  - restartservice ( RH/SUSE )
  - reloadservice ( RH/SUSE ) 
  - condrestartservice ( RH only ) 
  - forcereloadservice ( SUSE only ) 
  - tryrestartservice ( SUSE only ) 
  - probeservice ( SUSE only ) 
Both Pegasus CLI and Sblim wbemcli support the method interface tests

Note: Currently we use cimmofl utility to register the Pegasus mofs. Hence, for
Pegasus, any registration of the provider, has to be followed by a server 
restart before running these tests. 

Example:
Here, we present a sample of values for running the tests on Pegasus using CLI.
This is how the screen looks when the runtest_pegasus.sh script is run.
Note: The script runtest_wbemcli.sh is similar to the runtest_pegasus.sh script
and hence will run like the example below.

[root@bhrigus test]# ./runtest_pegasus.sh
This is the cli test for syslog service provider classes - service and serviceprocess
There are three types of test for this provider
1. Instance Tests 2. Association Tests 3. Method Tests
Give your input as integer values - 1, 2 or 3
3
Value entered:3
Enter the hostname on which the server is running. Give the FQDN ( Fully
Qualified Domain Name )
bhrigus.in.ibm.com
HostName:bhrigus.in.ibm.com
