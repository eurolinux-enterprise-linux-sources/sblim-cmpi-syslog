SBLIM Testsuite Enablement
--------------------------
                                                                                
The Syslog_Conf provider is integrated into the SBLIM Testsuite and can be
tested via the sblim testsuite.
                                                                                
Prerequisites :
                                                                                
- sblim-cmpi-base package propertly installed
- testsuite package
                                                                                
make test : test the existence of a testsuite directory
                                                                                
make install : install the input files into the corresponding testsuite
directories
                                                                                
make uninstall : delete the cmpi-base specific files out of the testsuite
directories
                                                                                
Run the test in the testsuite dir by executing . test-cmpi-syslog-conf.sh

NOTE: The sblim testsuite tests do not test the complete functionality of the
provider.

Old Test Scripts
-----------------

This directory contains the simple shell scripts that test the provider using
the command line interface.
The pegasus script has to be edited to put in the values for Pegasus_XXX for
your test environment.
The script restricts itself to testing only those interfaces that are supported by the clis.
We have two scripts -
   - runtest_pegasus.sh ( which uses the pegasus CLI )
   - runtest_wbemcli.sh ( which uses the sblim wbemcli )

This test suite tests the syslog conf provider interfaces.
The instance and association provider interfaces are tested in this script.

The instance interfaces tested are:
   - enuminstances ( for syslog_configuration and syslog_setting )
   - enuminstancenames ( for syslog_configuration and syslog_setting )
   - getinstance ( for syslog_configuration and syslog_setting )
   - deleteinstance ( for syslog_setting )
Both Pegasus CLI and Sblim wbemcli support the above mentioned instance tests
   - createinstance ( for syslog_setting )
Pegasus CLI does not support createinstance
wbemcli also does not seem to work correctly with createinstance
   
The association interfaces tested are:
   - associators ( for syslog_configuration and syslog_setting )
   - associatornames ( for syslog_configuration and syslog_setting )
   - references ( for syslog_configuration and syslog_setting )
   - referencenames ( for syslog_configuration and syslog_setting )
Both Pegasus CLI and Sblim wbemcli support the above mentioned association tests

Note: Currently we use cimmofl utility to register the Pegasus mofs. Hence, for
Pegasus, any registration of the provider, has to be followed by a server
restart before running these tests.
                                                                                
Example:
Here, we present a sample of values for running the tests on Pegasus using CLI.
This is how the screen looks when the runtest_pegasus.sh script is run.
Note: The script runtest_wbemcli.sh is similar to the runtest_pegasus.sh script
and hence will run like the example below.

[root@bhrigus test]# ./runtest_pegasus.sh
This is the cli test for syslog conf provider classes - configuration, setting and settingcontext
There are two types of test for this provider
1. Instance Tests 2. Association Tests
Give your input as integer values - 1 or 2

For setting getinstance, enter the key values for facility, priority and target, each on a new line
